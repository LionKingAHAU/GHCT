# 1. Brief Introduction 

  

We propose a novel approach called **G**raph residual connection attention **H**olistic processing multiple **C**hannels graph **T**ransformer(**GHCT**) for efficiently predicting interactions between lncRNAs and proteins. The core of GHCT lies in utilizing holistic attention processing. Specifically, we introduce an identity feature matrix to help the model better handle nodes within the graph, allowing the model to adaptively extract information from latent feature spaces, particularly in feature learning.

The figure illustrates the overall architecture of our model.
 

# 2. How to Use GHCT

 
> Our project is comprised of six main files.
> Please make sure that the **data** file and the **GHCT** file are in the same directory. 
> Then, **enter the GHCT directory and Run the commands as follows step by step**.


main.py: this script uses GHCT model to predict lncRNA-protein interactions.

```python

python main.py

```
If you want to use multiprocessing, you can run the following example.
```python

python main.py --use_multiprocessing True

```

 
# 3. Available Data


> In the `dataset_preprocessing/dataset` dir, we provide the data of NPInter v2.0 database, NPInter v3.0_H and NPInter v3.0_M .


> In the `data` dir. To prevent information leakage and to fairly evaluate the model, we split the three lncRNA-protein interaction datasets into a 5:5 ratio, we provide the data used in our paper.
